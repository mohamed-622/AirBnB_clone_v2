## Introduction

Welcome to the AirBnB Clone project! This is a group project written in Python, focusing on Object-Oriented Programming (OOP), back-end development, and using MySQL as a database with SQLAlchemy as the Object-Relational Mapping (ORM) tool.

### Project Timeline
- Project Start Date: September 15, 2023, 4:00 AM
- Project End Date: September 21, 2023, 4:00 AM
- Checker Release Date: September 16, 2023, 4:00 PM

### Important Note
Environment variables will be your best friend for this project! Make sure to set the following variables according to your development environment:

- HBNB_ENV: running environment ("dev" or "test" for now, "production" soon)
- HBNB_MYSQL_USER: MySQL username
- HBNB_MYSQL_PWD: MySQL password
- HBNB_MYSQL_HOST: MySQL hostname
- HBNB_MYSQL_DB: MySQL database name
- HBNB_TYPE_STORAGE: Type of storage used ("file" for FileStorage or "db" for DBStorage)

## Background Context

In this project, you will learn and implement various aspects of software development, including unit testing, function arguments, MySQL database creation and user management, ORM, environment variable usage, and more.

### General
- What is Unit testing and how to implement it in a large project
- What is *args and how to use it
- What is **kwargs and how to use it
- How to handle named arguments in a function
- How to create a MySQL database
- How to create a MySQL user and grant it privileges
- What ORM means
- How to map a Python Class to a MySQL table
- How to handle two different storage engines with the same codebase
- How to use environment variables
